  "description": "## Project Requirements: Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS frontend that accesses data from a public API or from a db.json file using json-server. Your API or db.json should return a collection of at least 5 objects with each object having at least 3 attributes. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format. Try to avoid using an API that requires a key. APIs that are free and require no authorization will be easiest to use. For ideas, see this list of no-auth APIsLinks to an external site.. If you would like to use an API that requires a key, please consult with your instructor on how to protect that key. NEVER push your API key to github!",
